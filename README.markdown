### TunnelSwitch is chrome extension.

[Latest Version: 1.0.1](http://ouyang.me/projects/tunnel-switch/tunnel-switch-1.0.1.crx)

You can use it to cycle your proxy setting in following modes:

* no proxy
* use pac file proxy
* use fixed server proxy, http/https/socks4/socks5 are supported.

Switchy is good, but the auto switch mode seems not work for me.
So I created TunnelSwitch.
